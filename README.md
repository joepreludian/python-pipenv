# python-pipenv

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joepreludian/python-pipenv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joepreludian/python-pipenv)

A docker image with Python and Pipenv installed. Also adding some libraries to support mysql, postgres and Pillow. This project aims to support my own personal projects and why not helping other ones; This image was created using the default Python (3.7), latest pip and latest pipenv built in.
The project was built on travis due to some test suites. Take a look on the Dockerfile for more details.
